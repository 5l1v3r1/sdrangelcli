# Prerequisites

</br>
#### Step 1. Node & Git

* Make sure you have [Git](https://www.git-scm.com) installed 
* Make sure you have [NodeJS 6.9+](https://nodejs.org/) or later installed on your machine
* Make sure you have npm (Node Package Manager, comes bundled with NodeJS) at least version 5

You can check whether you already have them and your current versions by executing 

```bash
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you need to use multiple node versions on your machine consider using:
* [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (OSX, Linux)
* [nodist](https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist) (Win)
* [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) (Win)

You might want update the `npm` to the latest version by doing:

```bash
sudo npm install npm -g
```
</br>
#### Step 2. Clone the repository and set up environment

```bash
# clone â†’ it will create the directory named 'sdrangelcli' in the current one
git clone https://github.com/f4exb/sdrangelcli

# install global dependencies
npm install -g @angular/cli
 
# install local dependencies
cd training
npm install
 
# check that everything is working but running the following and opening http://localhost:4200 in your browser afterwards
npm start
```
</br>
#### Step 3. Configure your IDE

We'll be wring code using TypeScript and Angular, so it would be nice to have at least code highlighting and autocompletion.
We recommend using:

* [Visual Studio Code (free)](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) - After the installation, run the IDE and make sure the recommended extensions are installed as described in this [guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_workspace-recommended-extensions). All extensions are listed under `.vscode/extension.json` and can be viewed in the UI using "Show workspace recommended extensions" filter.

#### Step 4. Install Angular Augury plugin

If you're using Chrome it might be a good idea to install the [Augury Plugin](https://augury.angular.io) that will help debugging Angular applications

# Sdrangelcli

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` or `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). This is good for TDD as the tests run continuously whenever the code changes on disk.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
